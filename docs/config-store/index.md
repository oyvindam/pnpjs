# @pnp/config-store

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40pnp%2Fconfig-store.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40pnp%2Fconfig-store)

This module provides a way to load application configuration from one or more providers and share it across an application in a consistent way. A provider can be anything - but we have included one to load information from a SharePoint list. This library is most helpful for larger applications where a formal configuration model is needed.

## Getting Started

Install the library and required dependencies

`npm install @pnp/sp @pnp/config-store --save`

See the topics below for usage:

* [configuration](configuration.md)
* [providers](providers.md)
